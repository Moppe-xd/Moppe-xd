I am currently in my final year as a student at KTH in the program [Civilingenjör och lärare](https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/civing-larare/civilingenjor-och-larare-300-hp-1.4108), where I will earn degrees in both **Computer Science** and **Teaching**.  

During my time at KTH, I have primarily worked with **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, and **MySQL**.  
I have also worked with languages such as **C**, **C++**, **Haskell**, and **Go**, and I have experience with **computer security**.  

I’m currently looking for work opportunities in the **Stockholm area**, starting in **early 2026**.
